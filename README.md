## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset: `online_sales`

### Table: `orders`
| Column Name | Type         | Description               |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| order_id    | INT (PK)     | Unique identifier         |
| order_date  | DATE         | Date of the order         |
| amount      | DECIMAL(10,2)| Order amount              |
| product_id  | INT          | ID of the product ordered |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Database and Table

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS online_sales;
USE online_sales;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL
);
```

### 2. Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (order_date, amount, product_id) VALUES
('2024-01-05', 100.00, 1),
('2024-01-15', 150.00, 2),
('2024-02-20', 200.00, 1),
('2024-03-10', 250.00, 3),
('2024-03-12', 100.00, 2),
('2024-04-05', 300.00, 3),
('2025-01-10', 175.00, 1),
('2025-02-15', 225.00, 2),
('2025-02-25', 275.00, 3),
('2025-03-01', 125.00, 1);
```

## üìä Query: Monthly Revenue and Volume

### Full Report (Grouped by Year/Month)

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    order_year, order_month
ORDER BY 
    order_year, order_month;
```

---

### Filtered Report: Orders from 2024

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_volume
FROM 
    orders
WHERE
    YEAR(order_date) = 2024
GROUP BY 
    order_year, order_month
ORDER BY 
    order_year, order_month;
```

## üìà Features Used

- `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)` ‚Äì Extracts the month from date.
- `GROUP BY` ‚Äì Aggregates results by year and month.
- `SUM(amount)` ‚Äì Calculates total revenue.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)` ‚Äì Counts unique orders (volume).
- `ORDER BY` ‚Äì Sorts the result chronologically.
- `LIMIT`, `WHERE` ‚Äì Filters for specific periods (e.g., 2024 only).
